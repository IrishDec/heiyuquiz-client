      <h1>Why Humans Love Quizzes</h1>

      <p>
        Quizzes have been part of human culture for centuries. Long before apps and websites,
        people gathered in pubs, classrooms, and living rooms to test knowledge, tell stories,
        and challenge one another with questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        At their core, quizzes work because they are simple. A question creates curiosity.
        An answer creates clarity. A score creates a moment of reflection or celebration.
        This fast feedback loop keeps people engaged without requiring a long time commitment.
      </p>

      <h2>Quizzes and Learning</h2>

      <p>
        Research consistently shows that actively recalling information helps memory more
        than passive reading. Quizzes encourage this recall in a low-pressure way.
        Even when someone gets a question wrong, the act of trying makes the correct answer
        easier to remember later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Short quizzes are especially effective. Five to ten questions is enough to create
        momentum without fatigue, making quizzes ideal for quick learning, revision,
        or warm-up activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Quizzes as Social Games</h2>

      <p>
        Humans are social by nature. Quizzes turn knowledge into conversation.
        Comparing answers, debating tricky questions, and sharing scores are what
        transform a quiz from a task into a shared experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Online quizzes extend this social aspect beyond physical spaces.
        A single link can bring together friends, classmates, or colleagues
        across different locations and time zones.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Friendly Competition Works</h2>

      <p>
        Leaderboards and scores add just enough competition to make quizzes exciting.
        The goal is not pressure, but participation. A small challenge encourages replay,
        sharing, and discussion without excluding casual players.
      </p>
