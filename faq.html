    <h2>What is HeiyuQuiz?</h2>
    <p>
      HeiyuQuiz is an online quiz platform that allows users to create and play quizzes on a wide
      range of topics. It is designed to be simple, fast, and accessible without requiring account
      creation.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I need to sign up to use HeiyuQuiz?</h2>
    <p>
      No. You can generate and play quizzes without creating an account or providing personal
      information. This keeps the experience quick and accessible for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>What topics can I create quizzes about?</h2>
    <p>
      HeiyuQuiz supports many topics, including Anime, Science, History, Geography, Movies,
      and General Knowledge. You can also enter custom topics to tailor quizzes to your interests.
    </p>

    <h2>Are the quiz questions reused?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Each quiz is generated dynamically, meaning questions are not pulled from a fixed list.
      This keeps quizzes fresh and reduces repetition, even when playing the same topic multiple times.
    </p>

    <h2>Is HeiyuQuiz suitable for classrooms?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Teachers often use HeiyuQuiz for revision, warm-up activities, and informal assessment.
      Because no login is required and it works in a browser, it can be used easily in classrooms
      or remote learning environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I use HeiyuQuiz for group games or trivia nights?</h2>
    <p>
      Absolutely. HeiyuQuiz works well for group play, whether in person or online. Quiz links
      can be shared easily, and time-based scoring adds friendly competition.
    </p>

    <h2>Does HeiyuQuiz work on mobile devices?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. HeiyuQuiz is mobile-friendly and works on phones, tablets, and desktops using a modern
      web browser. No downloads or installations are required.
    </p>

    <h2>Is HeiyuQuiz free to use?</h2>
    <p>
      HeiyuQuiz is free to use. Some features or improvements may be introduced in the future,
      but core quiz creation and play are available without charge.
    </p>

    <h2>Does HeiyuQuiz collect personal data?</h2>
    <p>
      HeiyuQuiz is designed to minimise data collection. You can play quizzes without creating
      an account. Any limited data used for site functionality is described in the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>How does scoring work?</h2>
    <p>
      Scores are based on correct answers and response time. Faster correct answers receive
      higher scores, which encourages quick thinking without penalising accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Why doesn’t HeiyuQuiz require an account?</h2>
    <p>
      Removing account requirements reduces friction and makes the platform more accessible.
      Users can start playing immediately without sharing personal details.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I suggest new features or report issues?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Feedback helps improve HeiyuQuiz. Feature ideas and bug reports can be submitted
      through the contact information listed on the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Is HeiyuQuiz suitable for all ages?</h2>
    <p>
      HeiyuQuiz is intended for general audiences. Quiz content depends on the chosen topic,
      so supervision may be appropriate for younger users depending on subject matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Will HeiyuQuiz add more categories?</h2>
    <p>
      Additional categories and improvements are planned over time. The goal is to expand
      quiz options while keeping the platform simple and reliable.
